        <h1>Topic Background</h1>
        <p> The social issue that this project is centered around is reproductive rights. More specfically, we wanted to focus on abortion rights for women. 
        The overturning of the Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade has affected many women across the United States, espccially women of color or low-income women who live in states that have now banned abortion
        Thus, we hope to use a motorized story board to depict the negative results of banning abortions.</p>
